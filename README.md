# Antisocial

![Comparison between player rendering enabled (left) and disabled (right)](https://github.com/qixils/antisocial/assets/13265322/03e15f70-d7e2-475a-9954-5902c7f534cf)

A simple utility mod that adds a keybind to toggle on and off the rendering of other players.
Hides player models, sprint particles,
and all nameplates (including non-player entities, since they are often used on modded servers for colored usernames).

Depends only on [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
